# Uber_Supply_Demand_Gap_Analysis
This project aims to analyze Uber's demand-supply gap using both SQL and Excel tools. The analysis is based on data extracted and processed from Uber's demand dataset.

**Project Overview**

This Jupyter Notebook contains the core data analysis scripts which:

Load Uber demand and supply data

Clean and preprocess the data

Perform gap analysis

Visualize key metrics and trends

**SQL Analysis**

We use SQL for querying the raw data to:

Compute trip counts by time and location

Find peak demand hours

Identify areas with persistent demand-supply gaps

To replicate the SQL part of this analysis:

Import the dataset into a SQL database (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Run the provided SQL scripts to extract insights.

**Excel Analysis**

We also provide guidance for analyzing the data using Excel:

Import the cleaned data into Excel

Use Pivot Tables to summarize demand and supply

Create Pivot Charts to visualize trends

Apply filters to drill down into specific areas and times
